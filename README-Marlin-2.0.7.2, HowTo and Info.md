## Firmware tinkering on Marlin-2.0.7.2 for Geeetech I3 Pro B

Further down in this document are instructions on how to trim, set up and install firmware on your printer.  

Please scroll through whole document so you don't miss anything. :-)  

Instructions below are run on a Linux system.  

Important note - MUST READ
==========
There is line you HAVE to change in configuraton.h before compiling this.  

Uncomment line 1454 to disable my skew correction values.  

	#define XY_SKEW_FACTOR 0.0

Comment these out again after you've made the test print and measurements. Read more below.  

(It's not really a disaster if you forget this, but you will get a more skewed print probably.)  

Other changes for different setups
==========
Below are changes you have to do, if you have a different setup than I have.  

IF you DON'T have a BLTouch or clone
----------
Comment out line 907  

	//#define BLTOUCH

IF you DON'T have T8 lead screws
----------
Comment out line 744  

	//#define PRO_B_WITH_LEADSCREW

IF you have the STOCK LCD screen
---------
Comment out line 2000  

	//#define REPRAP_DISCOUNT_FULL_GRAPHIC_SMART_CONTROLLER

and uncomment line 1850  

	#define REPRAP_DISCOUNT_SMART_CONTROLLER

If you have a BLTouch or clone, not mounted in the same way I have
----------
Check your probe offsets on line 997  

	#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { xx, yy, -zz }

Check offsets on lines 1002-  

	#define PROBING_MARGIN_LEFT xx
	#define PROBING_MARGIN_RIGHT xx
	#define PROBING_MARGIN_FRONT yy
	#define PROBING_MARGIN_BACK yy

Check values on line 1386 for the "Level Corners" option  

	  #define LEVEL_CORNERS_INSET_LFRB { xx, yy, xx, yy } // (mm) Left, Front, Right, Back insets

Changes from original firmware release
==========
These are my changes from the source firmware.  
Some things will perhaps have to be adapted to fit your printer setup.

Other possible changes in configuration.h
==========

Extra probing
----------
1025  

	#define MULTIPLE_PROBING 3

Compiling and uploading on Arduino IDE
==========
Download and install Arduino IDE 1.8.x from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software  

Open Arduino IDE and open /path/to/Marlin.ini  

Select board:  
Tools -> Board: ... -> Arduino AVR Boards -> Arduino 2560 or Mega 2560  

Select processor:  
Tools -> Processor: ... -> ATmega2560 (Mega 2560)  

 Set port:  
Tools -> /dev/ttyUSB0 or whatever...  

Select programmer:  
Tools -> Programmer: ... -> AVRISP  

Compile and upload!  

Permissions
==========
Check your permissions. You need to belong to the groups tty and dialout to be able to write to the tty/USB.  

Run  
>$ groups | grep ' tty ' && echo -e "\nGreat! \nYou are a member of 'tty'" || echo -e "\nError: \nYou are not a member of the group 'tty'. \n\nCorrect with 'sudo usermod -a -G tty $USER'"

and  
>$ groups | grep ' dialout ' && echo -e "\nGreat! \nYou are a member of 'dialout'" || echo -e "\nError: \nYou are not a member of the group 'dialout'. \n\nCorrect with 'sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER'"

to check.  

If you had to add yourself to any group, you must reboot to join the groups.  

>$ sudo reboot

Working with binary files
==========
Instead of directly uploading the compiled code with Arduino IDE you can save the compiled code for later upload.  

Export firmware to binary
----------
 Start Arduino IDE and select file and board as above.  

Click 'Sketch -> Export compiled binary'  

The IDE now compiles the firmware to a binary file in the same location as your Marlin.ini.  
It will be called Marlin.ino.mega.hex  

Move the file, and rename it to something sensible.  

avrdude
----------
Install avrdude if not installed.  
>$ sudo apt install avrdude

avrdude is already a part of the Arduino IDE, but this makes it easier to run.  

Upload binary
----------
>$ avrdude -v -q -p m2560 -c wiring -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -D -U flash:w:/path/to/image.hex:i

	[...]
	Send: M851 Z-0.8
	Recv: echo:Probe Z Offset: -0.80
	Recv: ok
	[...]
		
Save new value to EEPROM  

>M500

Higher value -> smaller distance from bed  
The above example will decrease the distance from the bed, ie. the gap between nozzle and bed will be smaller.  

This can of course also be done from the LCD-display.  

Skew factor
----------
Adapted from https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/blob/import-2.0.x/config/examples/Geeetech/Prusa%20i3%20Pro%20B/bltouch/README.md  

The skew factor must be adjusted for each printer:

- First, uncomment `#define XY_SKEW_FACTOR 0.0`, if commented

1445  

	  #define XY_SKEW_FACTOR 0.0

- Compile and upload the firmware.
- Then, print [YACS (Yet Another Calibration Square)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2563185). Hint, scale it considering a margin for brim (if used). The larger, the better to make error measurements.
- Measure the printed part according to the comments in the example configuration file, and set `XY_DIAG_AC`, `XY_DIAG_BD` and `Y_SIDE_AD`.

1439  

	  #define XY_DIAG_AC 282.8427124746
	  #define XY_DIAG_BD 282.8427124746
	  #define XY_SIDE_AD 200
  
- Comment `#define XY_SKEW_FACTOR 0.0` again.

1445  

	  //#define XY_SKEW_FACTOR 0.0

- Compile and upload again.
